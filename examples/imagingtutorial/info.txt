Dear EHT Collaborators, 
We're looking forward to the Imaging Tutorial today at 6:00 pm. At the tutorial we will show you how to generate your own synthetic VLBI data and use the eht-imaging python library to reconstruct your own images of M87. If you plan to attend, please prepare for the tutorial by following the instructions below. We look forward to imaging with you tomorrow!

DOWNLOAD THE EHT-IMAGING IMAGING LIBRARY:
https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging
Clone the repository and follow the installation instructions on the home page. Then, switch to the polrep branch (which contains new code to handle polarimetric imaging and calibration routines):
$ git clone https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging.git
$ cd het-imaging
$ git checkout polrep

DOWNLOAD ER5 DATA:
https://eventhorizontelescope.teamwork.com/#notebooks/130421
Put the low-band uvfits data in a folder called ER5 in the eht-imaging directory

RUN EXAMPLE SCRIPTS:
Run these example scripts from the ‘example’ directory of eht-imaging
